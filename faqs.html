            OpenUCLA, one of four initiatives of UCLA's Centennial Celebration, expands UCLA's commitment to providing
            open access to knowledge - creating a better future by removing barriers to scholarship. OpenUCLA celebrates
            UCLA's pursuit of open knowledge, making research publicly and globally accessible. New interfaces will
            enhance the experience and exploration of our exceptional open digital collections, including vibrant images
            and rare and unique texts, sounds, and moving images. OpenUCLA programming showcases open knowledge through
            exhibits, lectures, and events. OpenUCLA expands our local and global impact, building new sources of
            information about this city and our world for now and for the next century.

          <h3 class="ou-subpage-item--heading">What Is Open Access (OA)?</h3>
          <p class="ou-subpage-item--text">
            The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) defines Open Access as
            <span
              >"the free, immediate, online availability of research articles combined with the rights to use these
              articles fully in the digital environment".</span
            >
            Open Access is the needed modern update for the communication of research that fully utilizes the Internet
            for what it was originally built to do—accelerate research.
          </p>
          <p class="ou-subpage-item--text">
            <span>Funders invest in research to advance human knowledge and ultimately improve lives.</span> Open Access
            increases the return on that investment by ensuring the results of the research they fund can be read and
            built on by anyone.
          </p>
          <p class="ou-subpage-item--text">
            <span>Breakthroughs often come from unexpected places;</span>
            the Theory of Relativity was developed by a patent clerk. Open Access expands the number of potential
            contributors to research from just those at institutions wealthy enough to afford journal subscriptions to
            anyone with an internet connection.
          </p>
          <p class="ou-subpage-item--text">
            <span>Researchers benefit from having the widest possible audience.</span> Researchers provide their
            articles to publishers for free, because their compensation comes in the form of recognition for their
            findings. Open Access means more readers, more potential collaborators, more citations for their work, and
            ultimately more recognition.
          </p>
          <p class="ou-subpage-item--text">
            <span>The research enterprise itself benefits when the latest techniques can be easily used.</span> For
            years, we have had powerful text and data mining tools that can analyze the entire research literature,
            uncovering trends and connections that no human reader could. While publishers’ technical and legal barriers
            currently prevent their widespread use, Open Access empowers anyone to use these tools, which hold the
            potential of revolutionizing how research is conducted.
